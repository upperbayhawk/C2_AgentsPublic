Act like a data analyst. Examine all of the following time series data. The data is in CSV format with two columns: time and data value. The data values are at 5 minute intervals. The data values are from the newest data value to the oldest data value. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values for all the data values and return them. Also calculate the 15 minute running averages every 15 minutes using the latest 15 minute values for the data values and return the time and running averages along with the raw values used to calculate the running averages. If the newest of these running averages is greater than 80.00, then write out "GOLD" and write GAMEON, else if the newest of these running averages is greater than 60.00, the write out "SILVER" and write GAMEON, else if the newest of these running averages is greater than 40.00, then write out "BRONZE" and write GAMEON. If the three most recent running averages increase with time, the write out "3 HOURS", else if the two most recent running averages increase in time, then write out "2 HOURS, else write out "1 HOUR". Use two decimal places for all calculations.
