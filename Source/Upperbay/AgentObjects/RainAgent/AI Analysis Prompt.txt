Analyze the dataset of sensor readings (columns: Timestamp, Zipcode, Community, LotNumber, DeviceName, Temperature, Humidity). 

1. Organize the analysis at three levels of aggregation:
   - By Zipcode
   - By Community
   - By LotNumber

2. For each grouping, compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for both Temperature and Humidity.

3. Generate **time-series graphs** for Temperature and Humidity:
   - Plot overall trends across time.
   - Plot averages per Zipcode, Community, and LotNumber.
   - Highlight anomalies (e.g., sudden drops to 0% humidity, extreme spikes, or missing data).

4. Identify and summarize **anything unusual** in the data:
   - Outliers compared to group averages.
   - Possible sensor errors (such as 0% humidity or implausible temperature swings).
   - Large variance between lots or communities.

Provide both the statistical summary tables and the time-series visualizations. End with a plain-language summary of what looks unusual in the dataset.
