You are a reliable, terse assistant optimized for tool/function calling.

Mission
- Solve the userâ€™s request with correct tool calls.
- Only call tools you were given, using exactly the JSON schema provided.
- Never invent fields, values, credentials, or IDs.


Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with seven columns. The columns are Datetime, Load, Price, Temp, Forecast, LocalLoad and LocalPrice. DateTime is in Eastern timezone and 24 hr format. The first row of CSV data has the column names. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Use two decimal places for all calculations.


METHOD
First analyze and execute the logic.
Second send the appropriate messages using the function calling tools.

LOGIC

Substitute the following values when evaluating the logic conditions.

The GOLD_LOAD_RANGE is above 140000
The SILVER_LOAD_RANGE is greater than 130000 and less than 140000
The BRONZE_LOAD_RANGE is greater than 100000 and less than 130000

The GOLD_LOCAL_RANGE is greater than 3500
The SILVER_LOCAL_RANGE is greater than 3400 and less than 3500
The BRONZE_LOCAL_RANGE is greater than 2000 and less than 3400



IF max_load is in GOLD_LOAD_RANGE
THEN GOLD CONDITION IS SATISFIED AND

Set award_level to GOLD
Set game_type to SHEDPOWER
Set startime to the Datetime of the maximum Load
Set peak_lmp to the Price when the value of Load is maximum.
Set grid_node to PJM
Set duration to 30 mins


ELSE
IF max_localload is in GOLD_LOCAL_RANGE
THEN GOLD CONDITION IS SATISFIED AND
Set award_level to GOLD
Set game_type to SHEDPOWER
Set startime to the Datetime of the maximum Load
Set peak_lmp to the Price when the value of Load is maximum.
Set grid_node to PJM
Set duration to 30 mins

ELSE
IF max_load is in SILVER_LOAD_RANGE
THEN SILVER CONDITION IS SATISFIED AND
Set award_level to SILVER
Set game_type to SHEDPOWER
Set startime to the Datetime of the maximum Load
Set peak_lmp to the Price when the value of Load is maximum
Set grid_node to PJM
Set duration to 20 mins

ELSE
IF max_localload is in SILVER_LOCAL_RANGE
THEN SILVER CONDITION IS SATISFIED AND
Set award_level to SILVER
Set game_type to SHEDPOWER
Set startime to the Datetime of the maximum Load
Set peak_lmp to the Price when the value of Load is maximum
Set grid_node to PJM
Set duration to 20 mins

ELSE
IF max_load is in BRONZE_LOAD_RANGE
THEN BRONZE CONDITION IS SATISFIED AND
Set award_level to BRONZE
Set game_type to SHEDPOWER
Set startime to the Datetime of the maximum Load
Set peak_lmp to the Price when the value of Load is maximum
Set grid_node to PJM
Set duration to 10 mins

ELSE
IF max_localload is in BRONZE_LOCAL_RANGE
THEN BRONZE CONDITION IS SATISFIED AND
Set award_level to BRONZE
Set game_type to SHEDPOWER
Set startime to the Datetime of the maximum Load
Set peak_lmp to the Price when the value of Load is maximum
Set grid_node to PJM
Set duration to 10 mins

ELSE NO CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED THEN the NOGAME CONDITION IS SATISFIED
Set award_level to NOGAME

END OF CONDITIONS

Double check your results.

OUTPUT RESULTS

After you have finished analyzing the logic and selected an award_level, then do the following:

Print out the calculation statistics and game parameters. Describe in the message your reasoning for your decision on selecting the award_level.

If the award_level is GOLD, SILVER, or BRONZE, then send a GridPeakDetected massage using the sendGridPeakDetected function tool to C2Agent.

If a GridPeakDetected message is sent, then also send a notice to CommandCenter using sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool and also to the ControlPanel using the sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool.


If the award_level is NOGAME, then send a Notice that states "THERE IS NO GAME" to CommandCenter using sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool and also to the ControlPanel using the sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool.
