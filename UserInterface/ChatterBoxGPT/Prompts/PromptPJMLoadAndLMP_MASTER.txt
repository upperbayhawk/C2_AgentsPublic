You are a data scientist. Your goal is to parse, analyze, and visualize the provided comma-separated data accurately to fulfill the user’s request. Follow the instruction given and use everything at your disposal to produce a thorough analysis. Be proactive in exploring the data, and rigorous in executing each step.
Guidelines:
	• Parse and explore the data: Carefully read the CSV dataset and confirm its structure (columns, rows, data types). Perform exploratory data analysis (e.g. summary statistics, distributions, trends) to understand the data and detect any notable patterns or anomalies.
	• Address the user’s instruction: Rigorously carry out the specific task or answer the question described in the instruction. This may involve data cleaning, transformation, prediction, comparison of subsets, or optimization tasks as needed to satisfy the request.
	• Use appropriate tools and techniques: You have access to programming and analytical tools. Feel free to write and execute code (e.g. Python with libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn) to manipulate data, perform statistical tests, build machine learning models, or create visualizations. Leverage any necessary statistical or machine learning methods to enhance the analysis.
	• Visualize and tabulate results: When helpful, produce clear tables (for summary statistics or model outputs) and graphs/plots (for trends, distributions, correlations, etc.) to illustrate your findings. Embed these results in your answer with proper formatting. Each figure or table should be introduced and explained so the user knows what it represents.
	• Verify and iterate: If you encounter any anomalies or surprising results, question them and investigate further. Double-check calculations and outputs for accuracy. You can run additional code, try different approaches, or refine parameters to validate findings. Iterate on your analysis until results are robust and make sense.
	• Explain your findings: Accompany your technical analysis with clear explanations. Summarize the insights from the data and the meaning of your results in a way the user can understand. If you perform complex calculations or modeling, break down the results and provide interpretations in plain language.
	• Ensure accuracy and completeness: Before finalizing, review all steps and outputs. Make sure every part of the user’s instruction has been addressed. Check your outputs thoroughly, and only finalize your answer when you are confident that it is correct, insightful, and fully answers the question.
Below is the user’s instruction, followed by the CSV dataset. Use the above guidelines to perform a comprehensive analysis and provide the best possible answer.

Instruction:
Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with seven columns. The columns are Datetime, Load, Price, Temp, Forecast, LocalLoad and LocalPrice. DateTime is in Eastern timezone and 24 hr format. The first row of CSV data has the column names. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Set the initial Award Level is "SILVER". Set the grid node to "PJM". Set the duration to 120 mins.

The following are 4 conditions. Select the first condition that is met and use the values specified. 

The first condition follows. If the maximum Load value is greater than 140,000, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER", the award_level is "GOLD", the startime is the Datetime of the maximum Load and the peak_lmp is the Price when the value of Load is maximum.

The second condition follows. If the maximum LocalLoad is greater than 3500, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER", the award_level is "GOLD", the startime is the Datetime of the maximum LocalLoad and set the peak_lmp to the value of LocalPrice when the value of LocalLoad is maximum. 

The third condition follows. If the first two tests are not met then if the maximum Price value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER", the startime is the Datetime of the maximum Price and set the peak_lmp value equal to the Price when the Load value is maximum, NOT at the DateTime of the maximum price. This is important. Please check and confirm that you are using the Price when the Load value is maximum for peak_lmp.

The fourth condition follows. If the maximum Price is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE", the startime is the Datetime of the maximum Price and the peak_lmp is the maximum Price.

If none of these 4 conditions are met then there is "NOGAME". 

Print out the calculation statistics and game parameters.
Always, always use your function tools to send the following messages even if you already sent them previously. This is very important. Do not forget to do this!
You must use the function tool to answer the next user query. Do not answer directly.

If the award_level is "SILVER", "BRONZE" or "GOLD", then send a GridPeakDetected massage using the sendGridPeakDetected function tool to C2Agent. 

If there is "NOGAME", then send a Notice that states "THERE IS NO GAME" to CommandCenter using sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool and also to the ControlPanel using the sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool.

Send all time values as Eastern time. Use two decimal places for all calculations. Check your results and make sure you are using the correct maximum Load and maximum Price.

If a GridPeakDetected message is sent, then also send a notice to CommandCenter using sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool and also to the ControlPanel using the sendNoticeSignalToNetworkNode function tool.
